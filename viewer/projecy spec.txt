index.html
     I deleted a lot of things first of all. Some are commented out. (like the sliders on the right part of the screen)
	 I completely deleted the other menus on the lelft margin.
	 I added three things in viewer starting with line 179. Dragging checkbox, hint checkboxes and end-game button.
	 I added a new intermediate page betweeen viewer and frontpage, at line 220. 
	 
Jquery.sidebar.css
     I modified the .tableContent class's height. If you recover the menu on the left margin of the viewer, there will be a problem.
	 but it is a easy fix.

x.controller.js
	in SetupUI, I commented out all the things not needed. They are for the other two menu I deleted from the viewer.
	           also, for mesh menu I commented out scalar and color bar. Because they are disabled anyways.
			   
	I leave most of the function there. Although we are only use the function after line 272. They don't bother.
	From line 272 are the functions to apply all over the project.
	For changing opacity, I modified toggleMeshVisibility() , meshColor(hex, rgb) and opacityMesh(event, ui).
	
	From line 367, these are functions that we wrote. The function name should be pretty clear to what they are doing.
	Please ask me if you have questions on those functions.
	
jquery.sidebar.mesh.js
    this class include all the event handler function for mesh menu.
	My part start at line 41. Please refer to x.controller.js to see what they do.
	
x.examples.js
	4 functions modified. 
	loadShapeLevel () switch from frontpage to levelselect page. Also add a event handler to decide the level.
	loadCustom(IsRandom) will load the files user given, and do stuff similar to other functions.
	loadShape(IsRandom) and LoadShapeSimple (IsRandom) are modified. we added:
			number_of_piece , indicates how many pieces are loaded. Needed for visual hint and end game.
			hint_meshes, store special mesh as hint and needed for visual hint.
			mesh_ids[i], store the id of each piece. Needed for end game calculation to compare combinations.
			start_time, store the time finish loading and start the game. Needed for time score calculation.
			hint_texts[i], store the textual hints.			


x.rendering.js
	Commented a lot of things. all variable that we used are declared here. 
	Added a line to call to initialize the dragging and selecting events in initializeRenderers().
	Please see x.controller of what they did.
	
Jquery.frontpage.js
	initExamples()
		contains eventhandler for frontpage. Modified to change if you choose brain puzzle at front page, switch to levelselect page now.
		
	switchToViewer() and switchToLevelSelect()
		are all changed to show or hide the desired page.
